              <p>
                I am a software engineer, IT expert, and a nerd. Growing up I
                had always had a passion for taking things apart, breaking
                stuff, and figuring out how to put things back together again. I
                am a creative person and love creating and designing beautiful
                experiences and elegant software and solutions. Whether it be
                music, art, or technology, I just love to make things.

                I am also a natural problem solver and I get a lot of
                gratification solving difficult problems. I am A+ certified and
                can provide IT troubleshooting support. I've built and
                maintained several computers.
